My vim configuration since I would like to use it everywhere.
The git part is just version controlling it.

There is also a sedTricks file. Ideally this will grow to contain
all my config files...

SETUP (initial)
=========

1) in your home directory (or wherever .vim and .vimrc are located),
create a bare repo with 'git init --bare .configGit'
2) in your .bashrc or .bash_aliases file, add a line:
alias gitrc='git --git-dir=.configGit --work-tree=~/'
2.5) re-source your bashrc (source .bashrc)
3) run 'gitrc config core.excludesfile .vim/.gitignore'
This moves your gitignore file out of your home directory
6) in your home directory use gitrc just like you would use git
(so run vimgit add --all, vimgit commit for an initial commit)

SETUP (cloning)
==========
Rather than worry about the repo directory stuff, do the following

1) do steps 1-3 of the SETUP (initial)
2) add github as the origin branch (vimgit remote add origin <url>)
3) update .configGit/config to include the following section:
  [branch "master"]
    remote = origin
    merge = refs/heads/master
4) run gitrc pull
5) cd into .gitrc/bundle and look at the readme for vim setup
