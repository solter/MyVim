==vimgit==
==========

My vim configuration since I would like to use it everywhere.
The git part is just version controlling it.

There is also a sedTricks file. Ideally this will grow to contain
all my config files...

SETUP
=========

1) in your home directory (or wherever .vim and .vimrc are located),
create a bare repo with 'git init --bare .vimgit'
2) in your .bashrc or .bash_aliases file, add a line:
alias vimgit='--git-dir=.vimgit --work-tree=~/'
3) in the .vimgit/info/exclude file add the following lines:

  /*
  !.vimrc
  !.vim
  .vim/view
  .vim/.netrwhist
  !.vimgitREADME
  !sedTricks

*restart your bash session (run . .bashrc)
*in your home directory use vimgit just like you would use git
(so run vimgit add --all, vimgit commit for an initial commit)

Contents
===========
.vimrc, .vim, .vim/*
  vim files
.vimgitREADME
  a readme file (this)
sedTricks
  descriptions of sed commands since they are so obtuse
