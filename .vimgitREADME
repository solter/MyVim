==vimgit==
==========

My vim configuration since I would like to use it everywhere.
The git part is just version controlling it.

There is also a sedTricks file. Ideally this will grow to contain
all my config files...

SETUP (initial)
=========

1) in your home directory (or wherever .vim and .vimrc are located),
create a bare repo with 'git init --bare .vimgit'
2) in your .bashrc or .bash_aliases file, add a line:
alias vimgit='git --git-dir=.vimgit --work-tree=~/'
3) in the .vimgit/info/exclude file add the following lines:

  /*
  !.vimrc
  !.vim
  .vim/view
  .vim/.netrwhist
  !.vimgitREADME
  !sedTricks

4) restart your bash session (run . .bashrc)
5) in your home directory use vimgit just like you would use git
(so run vimgit add --all, vimgit commit for an initial commit)

SETUP (cloning)
==========
Rather than worry about the repo directory stuff, do the following

1) do steps 1-4 of the SETUP (initial)
2) add github as the origin branch (vimgit remote add origin <url>)
3) update .vimgit/config to include the following section:
  [branch "master"]
    remote = origin
    merge = refs/heads/master
4) run vimgit pull
5) cd into .vimgit/bundle and run the following:
  git clone git://github.com/nathanaelkane/vim-indent-guides.git

Contents

  a readme file (this)
