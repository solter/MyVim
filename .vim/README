The plugins should be installed (cloned) into
pack/standard/start (see :help package - dumping plugins into a "standard" namespace)

In older versions of vim, pathogen is used instead of the packages plugin.

Here are the "standard" plugins that peter users:
Plugin                  |    git repo
=========================================
      Tagbar            | https://github.com/majutsushi/tagbar.git
   Vim-Indent-Guides    | https://github.com/nathanaelkane/vim-indent-guides.git

After "installation", don't forget to run
:helptags ALL
