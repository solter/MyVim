This directory is used via the pathogen vimscript.
.vimrc is set up using the following plugins:
Plugin                  |    git repo
=========================================
      NERDTree          | https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree.git
     Syntastic          | https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic.git
      Tagbar            | https://github.com/majutsushi/tagbar.git
   Vim-Indent-Guides    | https://github.com/nathanaelkane/vim-indent-guides.git
    YouCompleteMe       | https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe.git

All of them except YouCompleteMe are simply git clone repo or
download, drag and drop.
YouCompleteMe is a little more complicated - it involves
submodules from git and needs compilation.
Hence I have included a zip of YouComplete Me in the
repo which is fully up to date (but you still need to install
it if you download it).
Pathogen is also included as it's a single file
